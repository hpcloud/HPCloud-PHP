 * Access to ObjectStorage (Swift).
 *
 * This is the primary piece of the Object Oriented representation of
 * the Object Storage service. Developers wishing to work at a low level
 * should use this API.
 *
 * There is also a stream wrapper interface that exposes ObjectStorage
 * to PHP's streams system. For common use of an object store, you may
 * prefer to use that system. (See HPCloud::Bootstrap).
 *
 * When constructing a new ObjectStorage object, you will need to know
 * what kind of authentication you are going to perform. Older
 * implementations of OpenStack provide a separate authentication
 * mechanism for Swift. You can use ObjectStorage::newFromSwiftAuth() to
 * perform this type of authentication.
 *
 * Newer versions use the IdentityServices authentication mechanism (see
 * HPCloud::Services::IdentityServices). That method is the preferred
 * method.
 *
 * Common Tasks
 *
 * - Create a new container with createContainer().
 * - List containers with containers().
 * - Remove a container with deleteContainer().
 *
 * @todo ObjectStorage is not yet constrained to a particular version
 * of the API. It attempts to use whatever version is passed in to the
 * URL. This is different than IdentityServices and CDN, which use a
 * fixed version.
